    fullText: '<strong>What to expect</strong>  Period pain, also referred to as dysmenorrhoea is most common in adolescents and women in their 20s. Although most of us will experience period pain, some will experience mild to moderate levels of discomfort while others may suffer from more severe pains. Period pain is a result of the muscles in your uterus tightening or contracting vigorously to help the lining of the uterus shed. As the contractions become stronger, it restricts blood flow to the tissue in your uterus, causing you to feel cramps.<strong>The most common symptoms of period pain are:</strong>Throbbing or cramping in the lower abdomen, Lower back pain, Nausea, headaches or diarrhea. <strong> For how long?</strong> Period pain generally lasts 48-72 hours during each cycle and is most commonly experienced when your period is the heaviest, which for most of us is the first few days of our periods. The good news is that period pain has been known to go away as we age and can reduce or completely stop after giving birth '
